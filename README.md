# lamoda-out-of-stock

## Project objective

To save stock states and analyze them in the context of 'out of stock' metric - it should show how many days in average each sku-size was out of stock.

## The problem to be solved

The problem is that Lamoda B2B client can only get current state of stock via Lamoda API. Lamoda API does not provide any historical data.

## Important note

This project is a draft version of similar project that will be based on Django in order to meet the future needs of the business.
